# SciPro

**SciPro** (Scientific Processing) is the object oriented scientific data analysis toolkit. Unlike a widely used way (eg. OriginLab or MATLAB) the experimantal data are presented as an object with numerous methods. So a typical pipeline data processing can be realised as a sequence of method's calls. SciPro based on NumPy, SciPy and PyLab (matplotlib) routines. It's developed for fast import and rapid processing and analysis of the experimantal data obtained with a wide range of scientific equipment like Oscilloscopes, Optical and Radio-Frequency Spectrum Analysers and other devices.
